            <h5><em>My hometown</em></h5>
            <img src='./images/Alcazaba-Almeria-1024x768.jpg'>
            <p>Almeria is a little town in the very south of Spain, by the Mediterranean sea, just a step away from Africa.<br>
            I lived there since I was born until I was 18, and life couldn't have been better.<br>
            It was a slow life, enjoing the little things and the good weather.</p>

            <p>Granada is also in the southern part of Spain, in a region called Andalucia. <br>
                I went to Univeristy to study Philosophy.<br>
            This is without a doubt the prettiest city I have lived in.<br>
            Every person I have come across that has been in Granada, describe it always with the same word: Granada is magic.</p>

            <img src='./images/spain-malaga-city-overview-and-beach.jpg'>
            <p>Malaga is a great city, it's beautiful, full of life (and turists) and hometown of the handsome Antonio Banderas<br>
            I lived a couple of years here.</p>

            <p>London it's just amazing.<br>
            I loved living here. The energy is awesome, the whole city has such a unique personality.<br>
            I learned English by myself, I grew as a person and I became stronger. <br>
            Moving to London changed my life in so many different ways. It made it better and opened my world.</p>
