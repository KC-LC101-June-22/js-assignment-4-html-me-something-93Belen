            <h4>Almeria</h4>
            <h5>My hometown</h5>
            <img src='./images/Alcazaba-Almeria-1024x768.jpg'>
            <p>Almeria is a little town in the very south of Spain, by the Mediterranean see, just a step away from Africa.<br>
            I lived here since I was born until I was 18, and life couldn't have been better<br>
            It's a slow life, where you enjoy the little things in life and the good weather.</p>

            <p>In Granada I went to Univeristy to study Philosophy.<br>
            This is without a doubt the prettiest city I have lived in.<br>
            Every person I have come across that has been in Granada, describe it always with the same word: Granada is magic.</p>

            I lived a couple of years here.</p>

            <p>London it's just amazing.<br>
            I loved living here. The energy is awesome, the whole city has such a unique personality.<br>
            I learned English by myself, I grew as a person and I became stronger. <br>
            Moving to London changed my life in so many different ways. It made it better and opened my world.</p>
